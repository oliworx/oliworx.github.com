### My talk at the PHP user group Munich, September 2023

Keeping your PHP dependencies up to date can be an annoying, error prone, repetitive never ending task,
especially if working with a multitude of PHP projects.

I want to show my approach to automate this process with [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/),
so I am able to update, merge and deploy 8 [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) applications every Monday morning 
right before I finish my first mug of coffee.

See my talk [_Let's automate composer updates_](https://gist.github.com/oliworx/d579f3b422289aa28790bddd83ed3206)
at the [PHP user group Munich](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/phpugmunich/).
